                            animation. As I am inspired to do so, I will include more code-types.

                            My personal philosophy about web design is that is a complex combination of diverse parts
                            brought together, which, if done well, appears easy, simple and clean even if below the
                            surface exist a series of complex moving parts.

                            CSS3, CSS libraries such as BootStrap and more. Much of my focus has been on maintenance and
                            management of a major non-profit website over the past ten years, but I am ready to grow my
                            personal portfolio again - stay tuned!<BR><BR>
