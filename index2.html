                        <p>This site is an evolving representation of my evolution in the world of web development. The
                            web is an ever evolving medium and so are all
                            the skills involved. What I love about working on the web is that it continues to challenge
                            my creativity and intellect. <br /><br />
                            I have worn many hats in this field and have seen the web evolve from static sites with very
                            little design in to full-stack applications. I am quick to learn and mostly self-taught.
                            However, I recently realized one of my dreams, to graduate from UC Berkeley's Full Stack Web
                            Development Bootcamp.<br /><br />

                            <!-- This site is a representation of my 2020 web education journey. The
                            web is an ever evolving medium and so are all
                            the skills involved. What I love about working on the web is that it continues to challenge
                            my creativity and intellect. I created this site with HTML5 and CSS3, including some
                            animation. As I am inspired to do so, I will include more code-types.
                            <br /><br />
                            My personal philosophy about web design is that is a complex combination of diverse parts
                            brought together, which, if done well, appears easy, simple and clean even if below the
                            surface exist a series of complex moving parts.
                            <br><br>
                            My arsenal of web technologies over the years has evolved from the beginnings of HTML, Adobe
                            Flash, DHTML, XML, JavaScript 1.0, ColdFusion to now learning modern JavaScript, JQuery,
                            CSS3, CSS libraries such as BootStrap and more. Much of my focus has been on maintenance and
                            management of a major non-profit website over the past ten years, but I am ready to grow my
                            personal portfolio again - stay tuned!<BR><BR>
                            Much of my experience is practical on-the-job experience, with focus on overall website
                            managment and implementing
                            the solutions that fit the situation, whether it be content, graphical, code-enhancements,
                            CMS management,
                            Google Ad Manager, SEO and social media integration. <br><br>
                            I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's Web Development Bootcamp wherein I am learning
                            HTML5, CSS3, CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, modern JavaScript, JQuery and the MERN stack.
                            Stay tuned!<BR><BR>
                            What technologies am I excited to explore more? Animations, UI/UX, delve deeper in to the
                            possibilities of CSS, JQuery, mobile optimization, "headless" CMS. -->
